            <h5>Dhaka Medical College was established in 1946. It was the first medical college of the then British regimen. Over the last 65 years the college which had been started with 50 MBBS students is now turned into a complete institute. The medical college is running with 40 postgraduate courses in different disciplines. At present 178 national merit best students plus 15 or more foreign students, are admitted each year. Addition of post graduate courses makes the institute very busy in all dimensions with some advantages and disadvantages.</h5>
            <br />
<           p>More over multiple sub-specialty subjects are running their outpatient department.and inpatient ward with post graduate courses. However, there are lots of new problems which should be minimized and solved with utmost attention.</p>

<br />
<h4 className="text-info">LIMITATIONS:</h4>

<p>Supporting staffs of the college at present are not sufficient enough to meet up the present demand and work load.
Post of teachers in internal medicine and many other sub-specialty subjects have been created without proportionate supporting staff and space.
Space for teaching learning exercise, training and assessment is inadequate in clinical and preclinical areas.
In the clinical side evening classes are not properly held and monitored.
Integrated teaching program could not be organized regularly due to vigorous in course assessment.
Shortage of tutorial class rooms hampered some academic activities.</p>

<br />
<h3 className="text-info">RECOMMENDATIONS:</h3>
<p>
1.  The most time demanding events like Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and  Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) never held before. We recommend for such.

2.   Exposure of the postgraduate trainee doctors to research methodology should be held in the institute at least twice in a year. Research Methodology course may be conducted & supervised by Community Medicine Department.

3.   Students should participate in small group teaching and PBL (problem based learning).

4.   Specimen/Models are older and should be replaced and increased   in numbers</p>

<p>I tried my best to prepare the annual report 2009.I am sure that there are possible mistakes and pitfalls in it which is unintentional. I must express my regards and thanks to the Principal, Vice-Principal, post graduate dean, all phase coordinators,  all faculty members, member secretary of MEU and junior doctors for giving me all sorts of cooperation& support in preparing this annual report.</p>
